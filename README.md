## For running/developing locally

- You would need the following templated environment variable file
  `.env.development.local` and then tweak it according to your specific instanc.

  ```env
  NODE_ENV=development

  USE_PROXY=true
  VUE_APP_SCHEME=http
  VUE_APP_API_URL=localhost:3000

  VUE_APP_API_URL_FOR_PROXY=localhost:8080
  VUE_APP_PROXY_BACKEND_URL="<<YOUR COLLEGE SPECIFIC URL FOR THAT APP>>"

  VUE_APP_MESS_ENDPOINT=<<API endpoint used to fetch mess cards for your instance>>
  VUE_APP_AUTH_ENDPOINT=<<API endpoint used to login for your instance>>

  META_DESC=<< Description for the site >>
  ```

  - `USE_PROXY`: if you want to use the actual backend instead of the mock local
    api server, then you'd need to specify the backend url for your specific
    uni, provided by their application

- run `npm run serve`
